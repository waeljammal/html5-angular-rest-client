HTML 5, Angular JS Rest Client

Sample code for potential employers.

Make sure you launch the java-spring-rest-server service by following the instructions in the java-spring-rest read me.

You can either copy this project into the src/main/webapp folder in the java-spring-rest-server and access it using localhost:8080 otherwise you should run this on a server such as a local Apache instance or use Wamp/Mamp to run it. Do not run it by double clicking the index.html file or it wont be able to resolve its paths correctly.
